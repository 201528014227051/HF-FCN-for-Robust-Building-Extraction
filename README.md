This is a state-of-the-art project for building extraction in high resolution remote sensing image using dataset [Massachusetts road & building dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/) . And, our approach was published in ACCV 2016, clik here to download [our paper](https://github.com/tczuo/HF-FCN-for-Robust-Building-Extraction/blob/master/0663.pdf)
